# GameBrowser

This is a utility for scanning Quake III Arena servers that I originally built in 2007 in VB6, and started to migrate it to C# back in 2010 before parking it in 2011 when I stopped playing as many online games and had no use for it anymore.

While on furlough during the COVID-19 pandemic, my family and I have been playing some older games, so I've created a game server on my home server for us to use and dug out this project to help with checking when the server was up. HOWEVER... the biggest problem with digging out old code is that you realise how poor it was and then you get the urge to make it better ðŸ˜„

In my defence... the original commit was code that was written almost 10 years ago.
